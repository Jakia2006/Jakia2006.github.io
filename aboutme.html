	<center><h1>About Me </h1></center>
<p> Hi! My name is Jakia. One thing I'm very interested is learning about the different aspects of Psychology.</p>
	
	<center><h1>Short-term goal</h1></center>
<p>After graduation from high school, my short-term academic plan after leaving high school is to attend a college of at least 4 years  and finish my undergraduate bachelor's degree first. I also wish to have a part time job alongside college in order to be independent and support my education.</p>
	
	<center><h1>Long-term goal</h1></center>
<p>My long-term professional plan is to pursue a career in Industrial and organizational psychology. In this feild, you focus on the beaviour od work place and recharch methods to inprove the work environment, in order to achive this, I would need to study subjects such as behaviorism. One of the subjects I enjoy the most is history. I love learning about the history of different countries, and the origins of traditions. I love to gain new knowledge about the world and human life. I also enjoy learning about the different beliefs systems around the world.</p>
